* Planets-lua

Planets with orbit, written in Lua.

All code is documented.

Idea and some code (but on JS) is
by [[https://github.com/DemetryF][Demetry]].

* Running

To run this demo without changing,
you need to install [[https://love2d.org/][Love2D]]
(current is 11.3).

To run, enter in terminal:
#+begin_src sh
$ love .
#+end_src

** Controls

*** Keyboard

To move, by default uses *arrows*.
To scale uses left *Ctrl* and *Alt*.

To change this, go to ~config.lua~.

*** Mouse

To move, *hold left key* and move.

To scale, use *mouse wheel*.

*** Touchscreen

To move, *hold finger* and move.

If you have physical menu button (now deprecated on Android),
you can add scale by key remapping in ~config.lua~

To make this, set:
#+begin_src lua
  controls = {
    sp = 'menu',    -- was lctrl
    sm = 'escape',  -- was lalt
  }
#+end_src

* Porting

This project is platform-independent, so
you can use any platform to run this demo (pls run at teapot).

All platform-independent code is located in
~point.lua~ and ~screen.lua~ files.
